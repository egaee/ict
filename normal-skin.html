    <h4>NORMAL SKIN</h4>
    <p>Normal skin is characterized by a balanced state, neither too oily nor too dry. It's typically smooth, even-toned, and has small, barely visible pores.  Normal skin is generally well-hydrated, with a healthy moisture barrier that protects against irritants and pollutants. This skin type is less prone to breakouts, sensitivity, or dryness.  It's often described as the "sweet spot" of skin types, with a balanced oil production and a healthy, radiant complexion</p>

<h4>Facts & Myths:</h4> 

<li>Normal skin is often considered the "sweet spot" of skin types. It's neither too oily nor too dry, and it's typically smooth, even-toned, and has small, barely visible pores.  Normal skin is well-hydrated, with a healthy moisture barrier that protects against irritants and pollutants.  It's less prone to breakouts, sensitivity, or dryness.  However, even normal skin can be affected by factors like age, stress, climate, hormonal shifts, and sun damage.  It's important to maintain a good skincare routine to keep normal skin healthy and radiant.  This includes using gentle cleansers, lightweight moisturizers, and sunscreen.  It's also important to avoid harsh products and excessive sun exposure.  While normal skin is generally less prone to problems, it's still important to be mindful of its needs and care for it properly</li>


<ol>-Many believe normal skin needs little care, that any product works, moisturizer is unnecessary, it's immune to aging, requires frequent exfoliation, or doesn't need sunscreen.  These are false.  Even normal skin needs a basic skincare routine (cleansing, moisturizing, sun protection) to prevent damage and aging.  Gentle, non-comedogenic products are best; over-exfoliation is harmful; and sunscreen is crucial for all skin types to prevent aging and cancer.  A personalized approach is key, as individual needs vary</ol>
 
<h4>Skincare Tips:</h4>

<ol>Maintaining healthy, normal skin involves a simple yet effective routine focused on maintaining its natural balance.  The key is to avoid disrupting the skin's natural moisture barrier and protecting it from environmental stressors.
 
<dt>Cleansing:</dt> 
<dd>Gently cleanse your face twice daily with a mild, non-foaming cleanser. Avoid harsh soaps or detergents that strip the skin of its natural oils.  Look for cleansers that are pH-balanced and hypoallergenic.</dd>
 
<dt>Moisturizing:</dt>
<dd>Even normal skin benefits from hydration. Use a lightweight, hydrating moisturizer to maintain the skin's moisture barrier and protect against environmental damage.  Consider moisturizers containing hyaluronic acid.<dd>
 
<dt>Sun Protection:</dt>
<dd>Daily sunscreen application is crucial, regardless of skin type. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to protect against harmful UV rays that contribute to premature aging and skin cancer.</dd>
 
<dt>Exfoliation:</dt>
<dd>Gentle exfoliation 2-3 times a week can help improve skin texture and cell turnover.  Avoid harsh scrubs or over-exfoliation, which can damage the skin's barrier.</dd>

<dt>Serums:</dt>
<dd>Consider adding a serum to target specific concerns, such as hydration (hyaluronic acid), anti-aging (vitamin A or retinol), or brightening.</dd>
 
<dt>Additional Tips:</dt>
<dd>Maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating a balanced diet, managing stress, and getting enough sleep.  These factors significantly impact skin health. Avoid harsh products and excessive sun exposure.  If you experience any skin concerns, consult a dermatologist for personalized advice</dd>
