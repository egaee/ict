    <h4>DRY SKIN</h4>
   <p> Dry skin is a common condition that happens when the skin doesn’t have enough moisture. It can feel tight, rough, itchy, or flaky, and is often caused by factors like cold weather, low humidity, harsh soaps, or long hot showers. In some cases, genetics or certain health conditions can also contribute. While dry skin can be uncomfortable, with the right care and hydration, it can be managed and improved.</p>

<h4>What is dry skin?</h4>
<P>Dry skin happens when your skin doesn’t have enough moisture to stay soft and smooth. The medical term for this is xeroderma, while xerosis refers to more severe dryness. It can feel rough, flaky, or scaly, and may or may not be itchy. In more serious cases, dry skin can crack, which might lead to pain or bleeding.</P>

<h4>Causes</h4>
<dt>Dry skin is due to water loss from the outer layer of skin. It might be caused by:</dt>
    <ol>Heat. Central heating, wood-burning stoves, space heaters and fireplaces all reduce humidity.</ol>
        <ol>Environment. Living in cold, windy conditions or low-humidity climates.</ol>
            <ol>Too much bathing or scrubbing. Taking long, hot showers or baths or scrubbing your skin too much can dry your skin. Bathing more than once a day can remove the natural oils from your skin too.</ol>
                <ol>Harsh soaps and detergents. Many popular soaps, detergents and shampoos strip moisture from your skin because they are formulated to remove oil.</ol>
                    <ol>Other skin conditions. People with skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis (eczema) or psoriasis are more likely to have dry skin.</ol>
                        <ol>Medical treatments. Some people develop dry, thick skin after undergoing treatment for cancer, receiving dialysis or taking certain medications.</ol>
                            <ol>Aging. As people age, the skin thins and produces less of the oils needed for the skin to retain water.</ol>



<p>Many people experience dry skin, but there are still common myths about how to treat it—some of which can actually make the problem worse. One typical reaction is to reach for the thickest, richest moisturizers, thinking they’ll fix the issue right away. However, not all heavy products are the best solution for every dry skin concern.</p>

<dt>Dry Skin Only Happens in Cold Weather (Myth)</dt>
    <dd>While dry skin is more common in colder months due to low humidity, it’s not just caused by cold temperatures. In summer, factors like air conditioning, strong UV rays, saltwater, and chlorine can also dry out the skin. Warm weather can actually dehydrate the skin too, so it’s important to stay hydrated and care for your skin even in hot climates or during sunny vacations.</dd>

<dt>Drinking More Water Fixes Dry Skin (Myth)</dt>
<dd>Dry skin happens when the skin’s barrier can’t hold in moisture properly, not just because the body lacks water. While staying hydrated and eating water-rich foods like cucumbers and watermelon is important for overall health, it mainly helps with dehydrated skin—not necessarily dry skin. To treat dry skin, it’s also essential to use the right moisturizers that help restore and protect the skin barrier.</dd>

<dt>Using a Richer Moisturizer Is Always Better (Myth)</dt>
<dd>Thick creams might seem like the best fix for dry skin, but they can feel heavy and may even cause breakouts—especially if your skin is more dehydrated than truly dry. It’s better to avoid moisturizers with artificial ingredients like silicones or mineral oils. Instead, choose products with natural ingredients that support the skin’s barrier, such as jojoba or avocado oils. These not only hydrate the skin effectively but do so without leaving a greasy feeling.</dd>

<dt>Facial Scrubs Cause More Dryness (Myth)</dt>
<dd>Facial scrubs with harsh beads can damage the skin’s protective barrier, potentially worsening dryness. However, skipping exfoliation altogether may reduce the effectiveness of your other skincare products. It’s recommended to use gentle facial scrubs 1–2 times a week to remove dead skin cells, which can help your skincare products absorb more effectively.

<dt>Dry Skin Needs More Oil-Based Products (Myth)</dt>
<dd>While dry skin may lack natural oils, it also needs proper moisture and hydration to stay healthy. Relying only on facial oils isn’t enough to maintain the skin’s moisture balance. It’s best to apply a moisturizer in the morning and use facial oil in the evening for optimal hydration.</dd>

<h4>To help heal dry skin and prevent its return, dermatologists recommend the following:</h4>

<dt>Use 5- to 10-minute baths and showers to hydrate your dry skin. When the humidity drops or your skin feels dry, be sure to:</dt>

    <dd>* Close the bathroom door.</dd>
        <dd>* Use warm rather than hot water.</dd>
            <dd>* Limit your time in the shower or bath to 5 or 10 minutes.</dd>
                <dd>* Wash with a gentle, fragrance-free cleanser.</dd>
                    <dd> * Apply enough cleanser to remove dirt and oil but avoid using so much that you see a thick lather.</dd>
                        <dd>* Blot your skin gently dry with a towel.</dd>
                            <dd>* Slather on the moisturizer immediately after drying your skin.</dd>
<br>
<dt>Apply moisturizer immediately after washing. Ointments, creams, and lotions (moisturizers) work by trapping existing moisture in your skin. To trap this much-needed moisture, you need to apply a moisturizer within few minutes of:</dt>
<dd>* Drying off after a shower or bath</dd>
    <dd>* Washing your face or hands</dd>
    <br>
<dt>Use an ointment or cream rather than a lotion. Ointments and creams are more effective and less irritating than lotions. Look for a cream or ointment that contains one or more of the following ingredients:</dt>

<li>Jojoba oil</li>
    <li>Dimethicone</li>
        <li>Glycerin</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid</li>
                <li>Lactic acid</li>
                    <li>Lanolin</li>
                        <li>Mineral oil</li>
                            <li>Petrolatum</li>
                                <li>Shea butter</li>
<br>
<dd>Wear lip balm or apply petroleum jelly to your lips. When choosing a lip balm, pick one that feels good on your lips. If your lips sting or tingle after you apply the lip balm, switch to one that does not cause this reaction.</dd>
    <dd>Use only gentle, fragrance-free skin care products. Some skin care products, such as deodorant soaps, are too harsh for dry, sensitive skin. Dermatologists recommend using products labeled "fragrance-free."</dd>
        <dd>If you see the word "unscented," the product can contain chemicals that neutralize or hide the odors of other ingredients. These chemicals can irritate dry, sensitive skin.</dd>
            <dd>Wear gloves. Our hands are often the first place we notice dry skin.</dd>
                <dd>Choose non-irritating clothes and laundry detergent.</dd>
                    <dd>Stay warm without cozying up to a fireplace or other heat source.</dd>
                        <dd>Add moisture to the air.</dd>

When dealing with dry skin, the ultimate goal is to add nourishing, natural oils, restore hydration and rebuild the skin’s moisture barrier. During treatment, it’s important to avoid stripping what natural oil the skin has.
