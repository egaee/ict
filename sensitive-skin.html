    <h4>SENSITIVE SKIN</h4>
 <p>  Do you have sensitive skin? Some people say that sensitive skin is from your family genes, and other side says that it came from the product that you use and not suit for your skin. According to Dr. Lewis, sensitive skin can generally be divided into four main types: naturally sensitive, environmentally sensitive, reactive, and thin

Generally, sensitive skin refers to your skin’s likelihood to become inflamed, overly dry or irritated, mostly from external factors. Sensitive skin can happen anywhere on the body but is generally more pronounced on delicate areas like the face, armpits, elbows or groin. Unfortunately, the face is the most exposed area and often receives the brunt of the symptoms. It is a condition where the skin is more prone to irritation, redness, burning, itching, or other unpleasant sensations in response to stimuli that wouldn't typically bother other skin types.</p>


<h4>What causes sensitive skin-</h4>

Sensitive skin is a general irritability of the nerve endings in the upper layers of the skin. There are many different causes of sensitive skin, from both internal and external origins. Everyday occurrences like showering, contact with perfumes, exposure to sunlight or even a stressful day at work can be enough to irritate sensitive skin.

 

<h4>Skincare tips</h4>
<p>And for you to prevent this type of skin 
you can use this tips to help your skin glow!</p>

<dt>• Test new products</dt>
<dd>If you are trying out a new product always do a patch test first. Apply a small amount to your wrists or behind you ear and wait 24 hours to see if you develop any reaction. </dd>
<dt>• Keep it natural</dt>
<dd>Avoid using products that contain harsh chemicals as these will likely upset your skin. Our range of products contain natural, organic ingredients that will soothe and nourish your skin. </dd>
<dt>• Less is more</dt>
<dd>Sensitive skin can be easily overwhelmed when too many products are used. Keep it simple and stick to using a gentle cleanser, toner, moisturiser and SPF. You can then use further products if you wish to target specific skin concerns, such as serum for an added anti-ageing, hydrating boost, or eye cream to reduce dark circles and fine lines.  </dd>
<dt>• Remove make up before going to bed</dt>
<dd>This tip applies to all skin types, not just sensitive! Make-up that isn't removed properly can lead to clogged pores and aggravate your skin. Our gentleActive Cleansing Lotion is water based and contains no artificial thickeners, so your skin will be left feeling clean and refreshed. </dd>
<dt>• Be gentle</dt>
<dd>Limit to washing your face twice daily – anymore and it could be too much for sensitive skin. Instead of rubbing your face dry, carefully dab it with a soft, clean towel and apply your following skincare products liketoner andmoisturiser straight away. </dd>
<dt>• Use sunscreen</dt>
<dd>An important tip for any skin type is the use of an effective SPF to block UVA and UVB rays. Sensitive skin can become especially irritable when exposed to UV rays. Wear an SPF of 30 or higher and wear it all year round, not just in the summer, as rays can still penetrate through clouds. </dd>
<dt>• Wash with warm water</dt>
<dd>Avoid washing your skin in very hot or cold temperatures, opt for lukewarm water instead so your skin does not become irritated. Washing your face with very hot water can strip it of its natural oils. This can cause your skin to dry out which can then lead to a compromised moisture barrier and potential skin concerns. </dd>
<dt>• Keep hydrated</dt>
<dd>Moisturising your sensitive skin twice a day helps to maintain the balance of your skin and drinking plenty of water will also help to keep your skin hydrated. A reusable water bottle is a great reminder to keep hydrated throughout the day as you can pop the bottle on your desk while you work away! As always, we love to opt for glass over plastic wherever possible. </dd>
<dt>• Cleanse regularly</dt>
<dd>Throughout the day, pollution in the air can damage your skin’s barrier. This can build up and cause your skin to become irritated. Cleanse twice every day to keep it free of dirt and impurities and at less chance of flare ups. </dd>
<dt>• Always read products labels</dt>
<dd>Choose products that are fragrance-free and contain no parabens – as these are the two most common causes of irritation and flare ups for those with sensitive skin. At ishga we are certified organic by the Soil Association so you can be guaranteed our products are both free from fragrances and parabens. </dd>

<h4>Advice</h4>

Dermatologists advise choosing gentle, fragrance-free, and hypoallergenic products,,.  This includes mild cleansers, lightweight moisturizers with ceramides or hyaluronic acid, and mineral-based sunscreens.  Avoid harsh ingredients like alcohol, fragrances, and strong exfoliants. Keep your skincare routine simple, and moisturize regularly to maintain the skin's barrier.
