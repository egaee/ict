   <h4> OILY SKIN</h4> 
<p>If you always carry blotting papers or notice your face getting greasy shortly after washing, you likely have oily skin type. This skin type is an excess production of sebum—the skin’s natural oil, which can lead to a shiny appearance and increase the chances of acne and blackheads. While it can be challenging to manage, a regular skincare routine can help keep oily skin healthy and balanced.</p>

<p>According to Thais H. Sakuma et al. Skin Pharmacology and Physiology via the National Library of Medicine. Oily skin, also called seborrhea is a common issue. It happens when the skin’s oil glands are larger than normal and make too much oil (sebum), making the skin look shiny and greasy.</p>

<p>Sebum is a natural oil that helps keep the skin and hair hydrated, protected, and healthy by maintaining a strong skin barrier. However, in oily skin, the sebaceous glands produce too much sebum, which can lead to issues such as  acne, blackheads, enlarged pores, and an overly shiny appearance. Managing oily skin can be challenging, that’s why it’s important to reduce excess oil without drying out the skin. Many oil-control products, like strong cleansers and toners, can actually strip away too much moisture. This process can cause the skin to overcompensate by producing even more sebum, exacerbating the problem. </p>

<h4>What causes oily skin? </h4>

<p>Oily skin is caused by the overproduction of sebum, and this usually happens due to several factors. Hormones, especially androgens like testosterone, control how much sebum the skin makes. During puberty, these hormone levels rise, which is why teens often have oily skin and acne. Hormonal changes during pregnancy or menopause can also affect oil levels.</p>

<p>As well as, environmental factors such as hot and humid conditions can make the skin produce more oil. Genetics matter too, If oily skin runs in your family, you’re more likely to have it. </p>

<p>Some medications, like corticosteroids, can also increase oil production. And if your skincare routine is too harsh and strips away natural oils, your skin might try to make up for it by producing even more oil. </p>

<p>When it comes to oily skin, there are countless myths and old beliefs that can make it difficult to figure out the best way to achieve clear and healthy skin.</p>

<h4>Some of myths about oily skin type:</h4>

<dt>1. Oily Skin = Dirty Skin (Myth)</dt>

<dd>Think your skin is oily because it’s dirty? That’s not true. Just because your T-zone gets shiny or you have frequent breakouts doesn’t mean your skin isn’t clean. According to Dr. Freiman, oily skin and acne aren’t caused by dirt—they’re often triggered by hormones, especially during adolescence, which cause the oil glands to become more active and clog pores. Believing that oily skin is dirty often leads people to over-wash their face or use harsh products, which can strip away natural oils and actually make the skin produce even more oil—causing more breakouts in the long run.</dd>

<dt>2. Oily Skin Comes from Eating Greasy Food (Myth)</dt>

<dd>Craving chips or fried food isn’t the best for your health, but it doesn’t necessarily cause oily skin. Dr. Freiman explains that acne and oily skin are usually not caused by what you eat. Hormones itself. That said, if you notice certain foods like milk or nuts make your acne worse, it’s a good idea to avoid them. Overall, oily skin is more about hormonal activity than diet.</dd>

<dt>3. Makeup Is the Best Way to Hide Oily Skin (Myth)</dt>

<dd>Dabbing on extra foundation, concealer, or powder might seem like a quick fix for shiny spots, but the problem goes deeper. Dr. Freiman explains that piling on cosmetics to cover oily skin can actually make things worse. While makeup can temporarily hide shine or breakouts. However, it can also clog pores, which may lead to even more oil and acne. </dd>

<h4>Oily skin: Best practices</h4>
<p>Dr. Freiman shares his bets tips for combatting oily skin and to help get your shine in control.<p>
<h4>Skin care:</h4>
<dd>• Wash your face with a mild cleanser (try Alyria, Toleriane, Cetaphil or Spectrogel) and warm water daily. Washing too often or too vigorously may actually make your acne and oily skin worse. </dd>
<dd>• Exfoliate once or twice per week (depending on skin type) with an exfoliant (try SwissTec Tri-foliant, Alyria Exfoliating cream).</dd>
<dd>• To keep your skin less oily and clean from acne, wear as little cosmetics as possible. Oil-free, water-based moisturizers and makeup should be used.</dd>
<dd>• Choose products that are "non-comedogenic" (this will help reduce the number of blackheads and whiteheads).</dd>
<dd>• Remove your cosmetics every night with mild soap or a gentle cleanser and water. </dd>
<dd>• A flesh-tinted acne lotion can safely hide blemishes. </dd>
<dd>• Loose powder in combination with an oil-free foundation is also good for cover-up.</dd>
<dd>• Avoid: excessive makeup wear and comedogenic/oil-based products.</dd>
<dd>• Look for: vitamin A or tretinoin prescription products, which decrease oil production.</dd>
<p>Over- the-counter products to try: salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and products containing glycolic acid.</p>


<p>The bottom line on oily skin is this – it’s not an overnight treatment. But with the right products and care, you can keep the shine at bay. “Oily skin and acne treatment is an ongoing process, and improvement takes time,” says Freiman. “It’s best to consult a dermatologist to do a skin assessment and determine the best treatment plan.” </p>

<h4>According to American Academy of Dermatology Association </h4>

<dt>To help control oily skin, dermatologists recommend the following tips:</dt>
<dd>1. DO cleanse your face up to twice daily and after sweating.</dd>
<dd>2. DO choose skin care products that are labeled “oil free” and “noncomedogenic.</dd>
<dd>3. DO use a gentle, foaming face wash.</dd>
<dd>4. DON’T use oil-based or alcohol-based</dd>
<dd>5. DO apply moisturizer after cleansing.</dd>
<dd>>6. DO wear sunscreen outdoors.</dd>
<dd>7. DO choose oil-free, water-based makeup.</dd>
